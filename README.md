## **Dashboard for Digital Publishers**

### Objective

This dashboard is designed for publishers and developers of educational digital tools.

**Problem Statement:**

Many players in the education sector, especially publishers, rely on traditional methods for outreach, such as using educational delegates. These methods can be inefficient in the face of a growing and complex digital market. There is a need for better targeting of schools, an overall view of the landscape, and regional clustering.

### Goals:

- Facilitate outreach for publishers and digital tool developers.
- Provide an overview of digital schools to identify market opportunities.
- Optimize targeting based on digital transition phases and subjects taught.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Distribution of Digital Schools:
- Number of digital schools (middle and high schools) by region and department.

### Size of Digital Schools:
Identification of digital schools with a large number of students.

### Public vs. Private Schools:
Comparison of digital school distribution between public and private sectors.

### Digital Transition Progress:
Track the evolution of digital transition through deployment phases.

### Subjects Taught:
Identify subjects taught in digital schools to tailor educational tools accordingly.
